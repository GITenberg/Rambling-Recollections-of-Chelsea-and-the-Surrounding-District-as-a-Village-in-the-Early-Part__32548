7</span>CHAPTER 1.&mdash;Early Recollections.</h2>
<p>In my early recollection Chelsea had many industries
characteristic of the village, which have entirely passed
away.&nbsp; The only conveyance&mdash;a two-horse stage coach,
called the &ldquo;Village Clock&rdquo;&mdash;used to run from the
Cross Keys, in Lawrence Street, twice a day, for one shilling to
Charing Cross, and one-and-six pence to the City.&nbsp; It would
<!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>stop to change horses at the &ldquo;Black Horse,&rdquo;
in Coventry Street.&nbsp; Time, from Chelsea, ten in the morning
and two in the afternoon; supposed to do the journey in an
hour&mdash;which it never did.&nbsp; This coach appeared to be as
much as was required, as it was seldom full, although it would go
round in the morning to pick up its regular passengers.</p>
<p>The roads and streets had a very different appearance at that
time, when the King&rsquo;s Road was like a country road, with a
toll gate on the north-east side of Sloane Square.&nbsp; By the
Asylum Wall, as far as Whitelands, there was no path at
all.&nbsp; Where Colville Terrace now stands was Colville&rsquo;s
Nursery, as far as Downing&rsquo;s Floorcloth Factory, with no
path, and on the opposite side from Whitelands to the White
Stiles was Siger&rsquo;s Nursery.&nbsp; The White
Stiles&mdash;where is now Avenue Terrace&mdash;was an open space
with a grand avenue of horse chestnuts and some old-fashioned
wood fence with two stone steps and a stile at each end, and
where Bywater Street and Markham Square stand was Morr&rsquo;s
Nursery.</p>
<p>The King&rsquo;s Road only took a second place in Chelsea
proper.&nbsp; Paradise Row and Cheyne Walk were considered the
busiest and most thriving parts of the village, as nearly all its
industries were located on the river bank, and nearly all the
best families lived in Cheyne Walk or Paradise Row, and in the
<!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>Royal Hospital, where the old soldiers used to pass the
board, and pensions were paid.</p>
<p>For a boy in those days there were but few opportunities for
amusement and recreation.&nbsp; The only resources we had were
rowing, running, swimming and boxing, to learn which was the
proper thing to do and nearly every boy&rsquo;s ambition.&nbsp; I
know it was mine, and as soon as I could save up two-and-six
pence and get a half holiday, I used to go up to Air Street,
Piccadilly, to a tavern on the right hand side kept by a retired
prize-fighter, there to have a lesson from a professional in the
&ldquo;noble art of self-defence,&rdquo; as it was then
called.&nbsp; There were always a lot of professionals waiting
about who used to take it in turns to give the lessons, and a
very shabby, disreputable lot they were.&nbsp; We had to pay one
shilling for the lesson and sixpence for the use of the room, the
lesson to last twenty minutes (which was quite long
enough.)&nbsp; You could have a wash and brush up if you knew
your way about and were a regular customer, and could always get
information of the whereabouts of a fight that was to come
off.&nbsp; After leaving I would walk down St. James&rsquo;
Street to Charing Cross, to the pastrycook&rsquo;s shop at the
left hand corner of Spring Gardens, and sit down at one of the
tables, and, as we then called it, &ldquo;do the Baron,&rdquo; by
<!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>ordering a sixpenny ice, or jelly and two cheese-cakes,
and give the pretty waitress the twopence change, and go home
proud and happy thinking of my next dissipation.&nbsp; These
expeditions were always taken alone, being too choice to be
shared with anyone else.</p>
<p>Downing&rsquo;s Floorcloth Factory, that I was speaking of,
was burnt down about 1829, having been set on fire one Saturday
night, and a young man about eighteen, named Butler, was hanged
for it.&nbsp; His father used to be a sort of odd man or jobbing
gardener for us, and a committee for his defence sat at our
house, mostly people belonging to the chapel that young Butler
was connected with.&nbsp; I used to be taken out to see an old
officer from Chelsea Hospital, who used to come in full uniform
with cocked hat and white plume of feathers, to be
chairman.&nbsp; I can see him now, going up the stairs with his
sword clinking on every stair.&nbsp; A memorial was sent in, but
was not successful.&nbsp; The evidence of a woman who knew him
and lived in one of the cottages at the back, stated that she
came home late on the Saturday and forgot to take in her
black-bird, and was woke up by its making a noise.&nbsp; She got
up to take it in, and saw young Butler in the factory yard
holding the dog by the chain and patting it.&nbsp; Butler had
only recently been discharged <!-- page 11--><a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>for some
irregularities.&nbsp; The place had been robbed as well as set on
fire.&nbsp; It was well known that others were in it, but they
escaped and were never taken, as there were no police at that
time, only the night watchman&mdash;a tall old soldier, who was
paid by subscription by the inhabitants, and used to perambulate
the streets and call out the hour and state of the
weather&mdash;such as &ldquo;Half-past two and a stormy
night,&rdquo; and would eke out his livelihood by calling up the
riverside labourers and lightermen at such times as the tide
served.</p>
<p>I well recollect the first policeman coming on duty in
Chelsea.&nbsp; Nearly all the school boys, nurse girls, and
children turned out to see him.&nbsp; His beat when I saw him was
along Green&rsquo;s Row by the dead wall of Burton&rsquo;s
Court.&nbsp; He was a tall, ungainly-looking countryman, dressed
in a blue bobtailed coat with white metal buttons, white duck
trousers, heavy blucher boots, and a top hat and white
gloves.&nbsp; For several days an admiring crowd persistently
followed him up and down his beat, a little way behind like the
tail of a comet, the crowd in the road and he on the path, but
the novelty wore off after a time.</p>
<p>At that time the Swan brewery stood at the bottom of Swan Walk
on the River, and between that and the Botanical Gardens was the
Skinner&rsquo;s Company&rsquo;s Dock and barge wharf, where the
state <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>barge was kept.&nbsp; Old Captain May
had charge of her, a worthy old man and quite an important
character among the riverside people, as he had the engaging of
the watermen to row the barge on Lord Mayor&rsquo;s Day and other
state occasions, and when they went swan-upping.&nbsp; As they
were well fed and well paid it was considered a desirable
appointment.&nbsp; It took eighteen watermen to row the barge,
and I think they were paid one guinea each for the day.&nbsp; We
used to think it a grand sight to see them in their scarlet coats
and badges, breeches, low shoes and silk stockings.&nbsp; It used
to be almost a holiday when they went out, as nobody could stick
to his work.&nbsp; The land between the barge house and the
brewery was a rare place to catch eels, and a favourite place for
us boys to lay night lines, as it was always well ground-baited
by the refuse from the brewery.&nbsp; I have taken twenty-four
eels off twenty-five hooks on a night line.&nbsp; There used to
be a grand day&rsquo;s sport for us boys once a year at the
brewery, on Good Friday.&nbsp; The drains from the brewery at
their outlet on the river were stopped up by ramming bags of sand
in them when the tide was down, and every boy or man that had a
dog (and there were but few who had not) would arrive as the tide
served inside the yard gates in readiness, and at a given signal
the hot liquor from the coppers <!-- page 13--><a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>would be let
down the drains, and in a few minutes out rushed the rats by the
score.&nbsp; Away went the dogs, and as all the outlets were
stopped there was a nice scrimmage, and there being a large
number of barrels in the yard that the rats could get between and
the dogs could not, it would last some time, for we had to move
the barrels, and a good many of the rats would get away.&nbsp; I
have seen them run up a barrel and get in the bung hole.&nbsp;
They were quite safe then, and it would drive the dogs almost
mad, and we had a job to get them away.</p>
<p>There were several notable characters along the
waterside.&nbsp; One hard-featured, powerful old man, named Jamie
Cator, had the reputation of being a remnant of the old press
gang&mdash;and he looked it every bit.&nbsp; He was morose,
dark-featured, heavily marked with the small-pox, and had a deep
scar from the comer of his mouth to the back of his jaw, which
did not add to his beauty.&nbsp; He was dressed in oiled canvas
trousers, a shiny black sailor&rsquo;s hat, and an old
pensioner&rsquo;s undress blue short coat, and was not looked
upon with respect.&nbsp; He had a small pension of some sort from
the navy, and used to eke out his living by bringing down the
floats of timber from the docks to the different timber yards,
and at other times to work on the sand-barges dredging in the
river.</p>
<p><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>There was another well-known character, a half-witted
fellow, who got his living by collecting corks and drift wood
that was washed in by the eddies at high tide.&nbsp; He had an
old boat that had been mended by tacking bits of old floor cloth
over the holes in her, and when afloat had always to have someone
baling out the water to keep her so.&nbsp; The Thames in those
days was considerably more of a highway than at present.&nbsp;
There were two watermen who went regularly up to Thames Street
every day as a sort of carriers, and would fetch or take anything
from a message to a house of furniture.&nbsp; They would
frequently bring a barrel of herrings, or two or three sacks of
potatoes, or anything they could buy cheap, and would go round
themselves with a bell and announce that they would sell in the
boat at the drawdock, at six in the evening, and in the winter
they would have one or two flaring lights and sell by Dutch
auction.&nbsp; Of course, we boys always attended these
sales.</p>
<p>In Paradise Row, were Harrison&rsquo;s, the tallow melters and
candle makers, who used to do the work under the shop in a
cellar, reached by a flap from the outside.&nbsp; Charlie, the
candle maker, was quite a favourite with us boys, for he would
occasionally invite two or three of us to supper in the
cellar.&nbsp; It was an understood thing that we <!-- page
15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>should bring some potatoes and enough money for a pot of
four half and half.&nbsp; We assembled as soon as the shop was
closed and the master gone, about half-past six; and then such
glorious suppers!&nbsp; I do not think I ever had such before or
since.&nbsp; Our first operation was to wash the potatoes, place
them in the furnace hole and cover them up with the ashes, and
rake out some more ashes and pat them well down.&nbsp; Next,
Charlie would go to a special fat-bin and bring forth five or six
lumps of fat, each containing a kidney, which by some mistake had
been left in.&nbsp; These were dexterously taken out, tied up
separately in a piece of thin lining kept for the purpose,
leaving a long loop.&nbsp; He would then string them on a dipping
rod, used for dipping the candles, place the rod across the
coppers and plunge them in the boiling fat.&nbsp; In about twenty
minutes they were done, and taken out, and the potatoes,
beautifully baked, divided between us.&nbsp; At times we were
short of plates, but that did not trouble us, for an inverted
saucepan lid answered every purpose.&nbsp; We would then sit and
tell stories till we were obliged to go home.&nbsp; Charlie used
to work all night Tuesday and Friday, as on those days they got
the fresh fat in from the butchers.</p>
<p>In the summer there was the grass-boat, owned by an old man
and his wife and a grown-up <!-- page 16--><a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>daughter.&nbsp; It had been an old ship&rsquo;s
jolly-boat, and had a roughly-built half deck cabin about the
size of a four-wheeled cab.&nbsp; The three of them lived in it,
and came twice a week to the draw-dock with bundles of coarse
rush grass cut in the marshes on the river&rsquo;s bank, to sell
to the local tradesmen to feed their horses, at three half-pence
a bundle; and all they had left was taken by the cowkeepers at a
penny a bundle.&nbsp; When there was no grass they would go
sand-dredging, getting the sand by a pole with a leather bag on
an iron frame at the end, with a rope to a block rigged up and
attached to a windlass.&nbsp; The old man would let down
gradually the pole, and the wife and daughter would wind it
up.&nbsp; They were a terribly drunken lot; but the temptation to
drink in those days in Chelsea was very much greater than at
present, for since I can recollect, in that one road not much
over a mile, from Battersea Bridge to Ebury Bridge on the canal,
there have been eighteen public houses closed, and only one new
license granted, and that is to the &ldquo;Chelsea
Pensioner.&rdquo;&nbsp; The names of the thirteen houses that I
alluded to were the &ldquo;Green Man&rdquo; at the bottom of
Beaufort Street, at the back of Luke Flood&rsquo;s house, the
&ldquo;Adam and Eve,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Cricketers,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Magpie and Stump,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Don Saltero,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;Yorkshire Grey,&rdquo; the &ldquo;King&rsquo;s
Head,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Old <!-- page 17--><a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>Swan,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;Fox and Hounds,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Snow Shoes,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;General Elliott,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Duke of York&rdquo;
(that was the house in Wilkie&rsquo;s picture of the reading of
the news of the Battle of Waterloo), the &ldquo;Rose and
Crown,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Cheshire Cheese,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Nell
Gwynn,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Marquess of Granby,&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Waterworks,&rdquo; and several beerhouses.&nbsp; All of
these houses have been closed or pulled down.</p>
<p>At the corner of Smith Street was the house where Tommy
Faulkner, who wrote the history of Chelsea, carried on his
business of bookseller, library keeper, stationer and
printer.&nbsp; There were some rich people at that end of
Paradise Row, several of them Quaker families, keeping two or
three servants.&nbsp; Near the corner of the alley leading into
Durham Mews, lived a doctor, a celebrated anatomist, and at the
bottom of his garden in the Mews stood a building with no window
that could be seen.&nbsp; That had the reputation of being the
dissecting room.&nbsp; None of us boys would pass it after dark,
as it was reported that the body snatchers who robbed the grave
yards, would bring the bodies in a sack to sell to the
doctor.</p>
<p>The present Children&rsquo;s Hospital was Miss
Pemberton&rsquo;s ladies&rsquo; school, Gough House, with a
lozenge-shaped grass plot and a carriage drive; an avenue of elm
trees led on each side to the house <!-- page 18--><a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>from the iron
entrance gates, by the side of which stood the coachhouse and
stables.</p>
<p>A trip to Clapham was quite an undertaking, as there were no
means of getting there but by walking.&nbsp; Once a year I used
to go with the mother to pay the ground rent.&nbsp; We had to
start after an early dinner and walk over Battersea Bridge along
the road, with fields on each side to the top of Surrey Lane,
pass Weller&rsquo;s Farm, and strike off to the left by a pathway
through cornfields to Long Hedge Farm&mdash;where the Chatham and
Dover works now stand&mdash;and pass through some water meadows
with bridges of planks across the dikes and penstocks, and up the
hill by the side of some old cottages that brought you out in the
Wandsworth Road; across a narrow footpath, a steep hill with
steps cut in the gravel, called Matrimony Hill, and through the
old churchyard.&nbsp; A few doors to the left was a ladies&rsquo;
school,&mdash;our destination.&nbsp; The lady we were to see was
a Miss Hart, a parlour boarder there.&nbsp; We were regaled with
biscuits and a glass of currant wine, which we quite appreciated,
to help us on our way home.</p>
<h2><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>CHAPTER 2.&mdash;Schoolboy Escapades.</h2>
<p>In Smith Street, at the corner of Durham Mews, stood Durham
House School, a large, square, rambling old building, without any
pretence to architectural design, apparently built at different
times.&nbsp; It contained over forty rooms and dormitories, with
a large playground at the back extending the whole length of the
mews.&nbsp; It was strictly a boarding school, and must have had
nearly one hundred boys training for Eton and Harrow and the
Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, mostly the sons of the
aristocracy and the leading families.&nbsp; Some of our most
eminent men were trained there.&nbsp; Some of the younger boys on
the fourth form were allowed out with the usher on the Wednesday
afternoons in the summer time, from two till six, to wander in
the fields and lanes to gather wild flowers and to receive
instruction in botany.&nbsp; I became acquainted with them at the
tuck shop in Queen Street, kept by an old crippled shoemaker,
where we used to gamble for sweets by an apparatus called a
&ldquo;doley.&rdquo;&nbsp; You dropped a marble down a spiral
column on to a tray at the bottom with a lot of indents for the
marble <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>to lodge in, all numbered, and the
highest number took the prize.</p>
<p>There were two ushers to the fourth form who took duty in
turns.&nbsp; One a stout, sombre-looking man, whose sole
enjoyment appeared to be to sit out on the riverside of the
Thames and smoke, drink beer, and read.&nbsp; I think I became
rather useful to the boys as I could always find them bait, and
knew where the best fishing was to be had, and would get them
white mice.&nbsp; The other usher was a very much younger man,
and better liked, as he would bring the boys to certain places
and leave us to ourselves, with strict instructions to meet him
at six.&nbsp; Usually the place of meeting was the Monster
Tavern, at the end of the Willow Walk.&nbsp; We very soon found
out that he was courting a young lady at a tavern in the Vauxhall
Bridge Road.&nbsp; I recollect one Wednesday before Palm Sunday
we had been left at the ferry to go over to Battersea fields for
the afternoon.&nbsp; We wandered about amusing ourselves till we
got to Latchmere, at the bottom of Pig Hill.&nbsp; They were then
building the South Western Railway, and the land was all open so
we wandered along by the side of the stream, about six feet wide,
that bounded the long gardens of the large houses in the
Wandsworth Road.&nbsp; It had willow trees on the banks on each
side, and we began to <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>gather palm, when we came to one tree
on the opposite bank that had some exceptionally fine bits, but
out of our reach.&nbsp; So we tied our handkerchiefs together,
placed a large stone in the end and threw them as a lasso over
the end of the branch and drew it to us.&nbsp; Four or five of us
pulled it over and held it while the others were to gather.&nbsp;
I was at the end pulling with all my strength, when all at once I
found myself lying on my face on the other side of the stream in
the garden, with the old gardener standing over me.&nbsp; I was
tolerably scared.&nbsp; He collared me and took me up the garden
into a sort of paved yard, and placed me between a dog kennel,
occupied by a tremendous mastiff, and a pump, just outside the
reach of the dog&rsquo;s chain.&nbsp; The dog seemed to treat me
with the most utter contempt.&nbsp; I do not think he would have
hurt me, as he simply walked up and down and sniffed a bit, and
then laid down and went to sleep.&nbsp; As I stood on one side I
had a view of the kitchen or scullery with the servants, and on
the other side through an open doorway in the wall, I had a view
of the lawn and flower garden, and the glass casements of the
dining room.</p>
<p>I was kept standing there for more than two hours, when my
captor, the old gardener, came and had a look at me, and went
into the house and <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>returned with a stout red-faced man,
with no hat and a white handkerchief round his neck, who went
into the house.&nbsp; It had got dark by this time, and the
lights were lit; he presently returned, and the cowardly old
brute, took me by the collar and almost choked me, and pressed
his great coarse knuckles into my neck, and tried to hurt me as
much as he could.&nbsp; I should have liked to have had him to
myself for a little time.&nbsp; I know his poor old shins would
have known it.&nbsp; He fairly dragged me into the house and
through a glass door into the dining room, where there were at
least ten or twelve ladies and gentlemen at dessert.&nbsp; I was
taken to the end of the table, where a tall, white-haired old
gentleman sat who was very deaf, and I was questioned by two or
three of them, and one gentleman who looked like a clergyman,
began to lecture me and said how wicked it was to come into a
gentleman&rsquo;s garden to steal the fruit.&nbsp; One young lady
said, &ldquo;Oh, Pa, that cannot be, there is no fruit
now.&rdquo;&nbsp; From questions by one and the other I had to
tell them everything; the usher&rsquo;s going courting seemed to
rather amuse the young people.&nbsp; After being seriously talked
to I was allowed to go, and was taken out into the front hall,
when one of the young ladies came out with a bunch of grapes and
some figs and thrust into my hand, and at the side <!-- page
23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>door
by the stables I was met by one of the maid servants with a lump
of pudding.&nbsp; I very soon made my way down Falcon Lane to the
High Street and turned into Church Street, and as I passed old
Battersea Church I knew it was nine o&rsquo;clock, as the bells
began to ring&mdash;as they did every evening at that time.&nbsp;
I think that was about the last of our Wednesday afternoon
outings alone, as it came to the knowledge of the usher, and he
was afraid it might get to the school authorities.</p>

<p>Entertainment or amusement in Chelsea was very poor, as there
was no room or place for the purpose.&nbsp; The only one I can
recollect was when a professor of mesmerism and clairvoyance came
down and took the skittle ground at the back of the &ldquo;George
and Dragon.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was a thin, shabby old man, dressed
in black with very dirty linen.&nbsp; With him were his wife, and
two girls&mdash;his daughters, he informed us&mdash;one about
twelve and the other about fourteen, with ringlets, shabbily
dressed and closely covered up in old cloaks.&nbsp; They did all
the advertising and canvassing themselves, by taking round the
bills and trying to sell tickets at sixpence each.&nbsp; The
sides of the skittle ground were decorated by the hanging of
table covers, curtains, pieces of carpet, sheets, or anything
else that would cover over the walls.&nbsp; The platform at the
end was composed of the taproom tables with some boards across,
an old square piano belonging to the house stood on the floor;
the lighting was effected by double tin sconces hung on the wall
with two tallow dips in each.&nbsp; The seating accommodation for
the ticket <!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>holders consisted of chairs; those
who paid threepence at the doors had forms or planks to sit on
with a gangway down the middle.&nbsp; The performance commenced
about seven by one of the young ladies playing the piano, and the
other a triangle, the old lady being engaged in taking the money
at the entrance.&nbsp; The professor mounted the platform and
addressed his audience, commenting upon the wonderful and
mysterious scene he was about to enact.&nbsp; He commenced with
the usual conjuring tricks of borrowing a hat and making a
pudding in it and bringing a live pigeon and a large cabbage out
of it, and then returning the hat undamaged to its owner, which
to us children was a great wonder.&nbsp; Then came the card
tricks, and the ventriloquial dialogue with the puppets, with a
handkerchief over each hand to form the figures, and then the
grand event of the evening.&nbsp; The table was removed from the
platform and replaced by two chairs, and the two girls, dressed
in white frocks and yellow sashes, came on.&nbsp; After
addressing the audience, he proceeded to throw the elder one into
a trance, which he appeared to succeed in doing, for she stood
perfectly upright and still.&nbsp; He then placed the two chairs
a certain distance apart, back to back, and taking the girl up in
his arms, laid her on her back with her head resting on the back
of one chair and her <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>feet on the other, and she remained
so for some minutes.&nbsp; Next he lifted up the other girl and
placed her standing with one foot on her sister&rsquo;s chest,
and the other at her knees, and she remained so for some minutes,
when she was taken down and placed with her back to the company
for the usual thought-reading performance.&nbsp; At the end, as
an extra, a pale, sickly youth was introduced, and sang
&ldquo;Wapping Old Stairs,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sally in our
Alley,&rdquo; the young lady playing the accompaniment, much to
the satisfaction of the company.&nbsp; At the conclusion a plate
was sent round to collect for the benefit of the artist.</p>
<p>Chelsea Regatta was a grand day, usually about Whitsuntide,
when rowing took place for various prizes, subscribed for by the
inhabitants, the publicans being the most active promoters, and
the leading gentry patrons and liberal subscribers; first among
them the Bayfords and the Owens, great rowing men and very
liberal to the watermen.&nbsp; I think one of the Bayfords was
the first winner of the silver sculls.&nbsp; The amount collected
at a time would be as much as fifty or sixty pounds.&nbsp; There
was a grand prize, a boat to cost twenty pounds, and various
money prizes.&nbsp; The limit of entries was twelve, to be drawn
by lot by Chelsea watermen, with certain restrictions.&nbsp; The
race was in two <!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>heats, six in a heat, the first and
second in the two heats to row in the final; the course from a
point opposite the &ldquo;Yorkshire Grey&rdquo; stairs, round a
boat moored opposite the &ldquo;Adam and Eve,&rdquo; back and
round a boat moored opposite the Brunswick Tea Gardens at Nine
Elms, and back to the starting point.&nbsp; The waterside on a
regatta day was like a fair, as there were always two or three
mountebanks, a circus and a dancing booth on the various pieces
of vacant ground in the neighbourhood of the river.&nbsp; Some of
the performers, dressed as clowns, played a kind of river
tournament, sitting straddle-legged on beer barrels afloat,
tilting at each other with long poles; the fun was to see them
tumble each other into the water.&nbsp; Then there was the old
woman drawn in a washing tub by four geese.&nbsp; After each
display the performers would march with a band to their different
places of entertainment.&nbsp; From out of the fund provided,
there were prizes given for running in sacks, and climbing the
greasy pole for a leg of mutton fixed at the top, and a prize for
running along a greased pole placed horizontally from the stem of
a coal barge, and extending over the water some twenty
feet.&nbsp; On a barge moored opposite the end of the pole were
four spars radiating with a basket at the end of each from a
capstan that revolved, containing a prize, and just <!-- page
28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>within reach of the end of the greased pole.&nbsp; One
was usually a small live pig, others a fat goose or a live duck
with its wings cut.&nbsp; The &ldquo;running the pole&rdquo; was
most difficult, for as soon as you got near the prize at the end
of the pole it would be dipped by the weight and slip you off
into the water; while if you got to the end of the pole and
touched the basket as it revolved it would fly away from
you.&nbsp; The live prize was the most difficult to contend with,
for you had to fight with it to get it on shore.&nbsp; The
proceedings all finished up with a grand display of
fireworks.&nbsp; On the following day the boat decked with flags,
in a van, would be drawn round the principal streets with the
watermen who had been engaged in the contest, singing some
doggerel verses composed for the occasion, and thanking the
people for their liberal subscriptions.</p>

29</span>CHAPTER 4.&mdash;Chelsea Notabilities.</h2>
<p>There were some notable people living in Cheyne Walk in those
days.&nbsp; At number three lived Mr. Goss, organist at St.
Luke&rsquo;s, afterwards at St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, who was
subsequently knighted.&nbsp; At number five lived Justice Neild,
an eccentric old bachelor, who left half a million of money to
the Queen, and next door lived Doctor Butler, curator of the
British Museum, and at Gothic House lived Mr. Moore, a man seven
feet high, and stout in proportion, dressed in a long drab coat,
breeches and Hessian boots with large tassels.&nbsp; He had been
a contractor for the stores and accoutrements for
Wellington&rsquo;s army in the Peninsular campaign.&nbsp; A
constant visitor was the Countess of Harrington, in a splendid
carriage with two tall footmen behind in a quaint brown livery
trimmed with gold lace, breeches and silk stockings.&nbsp; Then
there were the Owens and the Bayfords, very charitable
people.&nbsp; Then there was &ldquo;Don Saltero&rsquo;s&rdquo;
tavern, kept by a tall Scotchman and his factotum, a little short
fat man, a sort of &ldquo;Joe Willett of the Maypole,&rdquo; who
was barman, cellarman, and waiter in one.&nbsp; There <!-- page
30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>used
to be a goodly company of an evening in the coffee room of
retired officers and well-to-do people in the neighbourhood, to
play whist and chess, and sometimes all-fours.&nbsp; There was an
ordinary on Sunday at two o&rsquo;clock, when they gave you a
rare good dinner for two-and-sixpence, including beer.</p>
<p>I well recollect the Kingsleys coming to Chelsea, I think it
was about the year 1832.&nbsp; I know it was near about the
&ldquo;cholera year.&rdquo;&nbsp; The first time I saw Charles
and Henry they were boys about twelve and fourteen.&nbsp; I met
them in the rectory garden at the giving of prizes to the St.
Luke&rsquo;s National School boys, when they were regaled with
buns and milk.&nbsp; The rector and the boys were great
favourites with the parishioners as they were courteous and very
free with everybody.&nbsp; I can recognize many of the characters
in &ldquo;The Hillyars and the Burtons&rdquo; as old Chelsea
inhabitants, and the description of the mounds and tablets in old
Chelsea Church and the Churchyard, and the outlook over the river
is as correct as it well can be.</p>
<p>Opposite the Church in the corner by the Church draw-dock
stood the cage, and by the side of it the stocks, then came
Lombard Street, and the archway with shops and wharfs all along
the riverside up to Battersea Bridge.&nbsp; At that time there
were fishing boats, and fishermen got a living by catching roach,
<!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>dace, dabs and flounders, and setting pots for eels all
along Chelsea Reach, and between Battersea Bridge and Putney, and
they would hawk them through the streets of a morning.&nbsp; The
eels were carried in little tubs, as many as eight or ten, one on
top of the other, on the man&rsquo;s head, and sold by the lot in
each tub at about sixpence or eightpence each.</p>
<p>The favourite promenade, especially on a Sunday, was the River
Terrace at the back of Chelsea Hospital.&nbsp; It was thrown open
to the public, and you gained access to it from the gate of the
private gardens opposite King Charles&rsquo; statue.&nbsp; It
consisted of a gravelled terrace and a dwarf wall on the river
side, with two rows of immense elms commencing at the outlet of
Ranelagh Ditch to the river, and ending at the Round House.&nbsp;
On the corner by Ranelagh Ditch stood the College Water Works,
with the old machinery going to decay, that had been used to pump
water for the use of the hospital.&nbsp; This was a grand place,
and considered extremely fashionable, where most of the courting
and flirting by the young people was carried on.&nbsp; The
Ranelagh Ditch was the boundary of the hospital grounds at that
tune, and was an open stream about nine feet wide; while its
banks were supported by planks and struts across it.&nbsp; It was
open right up to the end of Eaton Place.&nbsp; It was crossed by
two bridges, one <!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>called Ranelagh, in the Pimlico Road,
by the side of the &ldquo;Nell Gwynn&rdquo; tavern, the other
called Bloody Bridge, in the King&rsquo;s Road, between Sloane
Square and Westbourne Street.&nbsp; On the banks of this foul and
offensive stream there was no better than a common sewer.&nbsp;
Between the two bridges at the back of George Street and
overlooking it, were crowded together a lot of old two and
three-roomed cottages that periodically at high tide were flooded
by the offensive matter.&nbsp; The district was known as
Frog&rsquo;s Island, and suffered terribly in the outbreak of
cholera in 1832.&nbsp; It was inhabited by a class that was
always in a chronic state of poverty, and as there had been a
very severe winter, that had a great deal to do with it.&nbsp; I
think this stream is now covered over.&nbsp; It had its rise from
the overflow in the Serpentine, in Hyde Park, and crossed under
the road at Knightsbridge, about where Albert Gate now stands,
into the Park. <a name="citation32"></a><a href="#footnote32"

<h2><!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>CHAPTER 5.&mdash;Old-time Chelsea.</h2>
<p>It was a grand sight on the first of May to see the four-horse
mail coaches pass along Knightsbridge at eight in the
evening.&nbsp; As many as fourteen would pass all in their new
livery of scarlet coats and broad-brimmed top hats, trimmed with
gold lace, the guards blowing their horns.&nbsp; I have seen them
take up passengers at the top of Sloane Street, who arrived there
in one of the old two-horse hackney coaches, and it appeared
quite an undertaking to get the passengers on board.&nbsp; They
would branch off there, some going along the upper road through
Kensington, and the others along the Fulham Road and across the
river at Putney.&nbsp; The road from Chelsea to Buckingham Palace
was mostly through fields, some of them called the Five Fields
(now Eaton Square and neighbourhood), extending as far as
Grosvenor Place and St. George&rsquo;s Hospital, which you could
see from the toll-gate in Sloane Squire, the only building on
that part being Eaton Chapel.&nbsp; The road to the Palace was
very lonely, as there were but few houses.&nbsp; The Chelsea Bun
Houses&mdash;there were two of them&mdash;<!-- page 34--><a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>stood on the
left side of the Pimlico Road, about one hundred yards beyond the
toll-gate by the &ldquo;Nell Gwynn&rdquo; tavern.&nbsp; The first
one kept at that time by London, had a frontage of at least fifty
feet.&nbsp; It was built out fifteen or twenty feet from the
house, and had a colonnade in front over the pathway; the other,
kept by Chapman, was two doors further on, of the same style but
much smaller.&nbsp; On a Good Friday morning I have seen a large
crowd waiting to get served, which they did through the
window.&nbsp; I have seen carriages and traps waiting as far as
the tollhouse.&nbsp; A little farther on, where St.
Barnabas&rsquo; Church now stands, was the &ldquo;Orange&rdquo;
tavern and tea gardens, with a theatre where regular plays were
acted, and beyond, just before you came to the wooden bridge over
the canal there was a road leading down to the Chelsea Water
Works reservoir and filtering beds, and at the bottom stood the
&ldquo;White House,&rdquo; with its ferry over to the &ldquo;Red
House&rdquo; at Battersea, a great sporting riverside house,
where nearly all the pigeon shooting took place.&nbsp; There was
always a great crowd of amateur sportsmen outside waiting for a
shot at any birds that escaped, and frequently a dispute would
arise as to who shot the bird, often ending in a fight.</p>
<p>There were no buildings on the right hand side of <!-- page
35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>the
road, but some marshy ground and a row of willow trees between it
and the canal as far as the basin, which was surrounded by a few
shops and wharves, and where Victoria Station now stands.&nbsp;
And nearly opposite stood Bramah&rsquo;s Iron Foundry, where
nearly the first iron lighthouse was built and fitted together
and erected in the yard complete, and then taken and shipped to
one of the West India Islands, I think Jamaica, and
re-erected.&nbsp; It was afterward&rsquo;s Bramah&rsquo;s Great
Unpickable Lock Factory.</p>
<p>At the other side of the canal was the Willow Walk, a raised
road leading from the Monster Gardens to Rochester Row, with
market gardens and low swampy ground running right down to the
river on one side, and the canal on the other.&nbsp; In winter I
have seen snipe, teal and wild duck shot on the ground at the
west end of Chelsea.&nbsp; Just over Stamford Bridge stood
Stamford House, once the residence of Nell Gwynn, now occupied by
the Gas Company&rsquo;s engineer, and just beyond, through a farm
yard, was a public footpath right through the orchards and market
gardens alongside of the river right away to a riverside tavern,
with a lane bringing you out by Parson&rsquo;s Green.&nbsp; In
the orchards was grown some of the choicest fruit to be found in
the country.&nbsp; There were some old walls <!-- page 36--><a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>with fruit
trees that appeared to have stood there for centuries.&nbsp; This
district was known as Broom-house, and was owned and occupied by
the Bagleys, Steels, Matters, and Dancers, market gardeners and
fruit growers.&nbsp; Higher up the river at Hammersmith, Chiswick
and Isleworth were the strawberry gardens that supplied London
with that delicious fruit.&nbsp; They were carried to Covent
Garden Market twice a day by women in large round baskets on
their heads.&nbsp; You would meet them along the road of a
morning about seven, and again about three with a second picking,
always on the trot, in gangs of as many as twenty.&nbsp; The
strawberries were packed in small tapering baskets called
pottles, holding about two-thirds of a pint, and then in large
baskets called rounds, containing seventy-two pottles; these
rounds containing seventy-two pottles would sell at from twelve
to sixty shillings, according to the season and quality of the
fruit.&nbsp; This was considered a very profitable industry as
both pickers and the carriers were much better paid than the
ordinary employees.&nbsp; It was quite a harvest, and lasted from
three weeks to a month.</p>
<p>The lying in state of the Duke of Wellington was held in the
dining hall of Chelsea Hospital.&nbsp; There was a raised
platform at the west end beautifully draped in black velvet and
white silk, with silver <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>cords and tassels.&nbsp; The coffin
was attended by four officers, generals, as chief mourners, and
the gangway that the public passed along was lined with
guardsmen.&nbsp; During the ten days for which the body was on
view the crowd was immense, and on about the third day there were
two women trampled to death, and a great number injured, owing,
it was supposed, to a number of artillerymen marching up in a
body and trying to force their way through the crowd.&nbsp; Steps
were immediately taken to erect barricades, and police officers
were stationed to regulate the crowd.&nbsp; As it extended three
parts of the way up Ebury Street, some had to wait from five to
six hours, only a certain number being allowed to pass round at a
time, and there were many taken out of the crowd that could not
stand the crush and had fainted.</p>
<p>The Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race was best seen from Cheyne
Walk as the course at that time was from Westminster to Putney,
for that and all other leading races, and the race was considered
a dead certainty for whichever boat got through Battersea Bridge
first and had the Middlesex shore.</p>
<p>They used to have some tolerably good sailing matches for
small boats off Chelsea Reach.&nbsp; The course was from a boat
moored opposite the &ldquo;Adam and Eve,&rdquo; turning round a
boat moored off Lambeth <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>Palace, and back to the starting
point.&nbsp; Races were arranged to start at about
three-quarter&rsquo;s flood so that they would finish on the ebb
of the tide.&nbsp; They were small tubby-looking, half-decked
boats, not above three tons, and would carry an immense amount of
canvas, and when there was a breeze and the river was a little
bit lumpy they would dance about merrily and were a very pretty
sight.&nbsp; They were generally sailed by the owners.</p>
<h2><!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>CHAPTER 6.&mdash;Public Gardens.</h2>
<p>The first public garden that I recollect, long before
Cremorne, was the Manor House in the King&rsquo;s Road, between
Little&rsquo;s Nursery and Shawfield Street, where Radnor Street
and the Commercial Tavern now stand.&nbsp; It was a detached
house with carriage drive in front, and grounds reaching to where
the bottom of Radnor Street is.&nbsp; It used to be occupied by
one, Colonel Middleton, and in about 1836 it was taken by a man
of the name of Smith, and turned into a tea and recreation
garden, a sort of little Vauxhall with coloured lamps, statuary,
shrubbery, winding path and fountain, with music and
dancing.&nbsp; Flexmar the clown, when a youth, was one of the
regular visitors and would amuse the company with a break-down
dance, and the great Mackney, the negro delineator and stump
orator (I believe still on the music hall stage), as a youth was
a very clever violinist, and would entertain the company by
playing in almost any position and imitating almost any
sound.&nbsp; It was carried on only a few years, after which the
owners built <!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>the Commercial Tavern, with a large
room behind, now Radnor Chapel.&nbsp; The grounds were laid out
for builders, and Radnor Street was built, leaving the old Manor
House standing at the corner in the King&rsquo;s Road.&nbsp; It
was then turned into the Chelsea Literary and Scientific
Institution, and so continued until removed to the Chelsea Town
Hall.&nbsp; It struggled on for a few years and then came to
grief.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Cremorne</span>.&mdash;The first I
recollect of Cremorne was a man known as Baron de Barranger, who
used to ride about in grey military uniform with his two sons,
tall, military-looking men.&nbsp; They carried on a sort of
livery stable and tavern at Cremorne House, by the river, and
called it the Stadium Canteen.&nbsp; It was on a road by the
river, leading from the bottom of Cremorne Lane past Cremorne and
Ashburton House and the cottage to the Lammas Lands, known as the
Lots meadows, some eight or ten acres in extent, which was sold
by the parish for about three or four hundred pounds.&nbsp; There
was, even in De Barranger&rsquo;s time, some entertainment at
Cremorne, for in the meadow known as Cremorne Meadow on the
opposite side of the King&rsquo;s Road, a fair was held, and at
Cremorne ground some pony races and a horse and sporting-dog
show, but the commencement of Cremorne as a place of public
entertainment was in about 1839, under Baron <!-- page 41--><a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>Nicholson, of
the Garrick Head, in Bow Street.&nbsp; This was where the
&ldquo;Judge and Jury&rdquo; was held, with Baron Nicholson as
the presiding judge, when counsel used to appear in wig and gown,
and very remarkable mock trials were held, the evidence being of
a broad and indecent character.&nbsp; The partner of the Baron in
organising the fete at Cremorne was a man of the name of
Littlejohn.&nbsp; It was extensively advertised by bands of music
drawn about in stage coaches, and was called a &ldquo;Thousand
Guinea Fete.&rdquo;&nbsp; The entertainment lasted three days,
and dancing, singing, music and drinking went on till the small
hours of the morning.&nbsp; This, I believe, was not a commercial
success.</p>
<p>Two years after the place was opened by a Mr. Ellis, I think,
a musical man connected with Drury Lane Theatre; regular
entertainments were provided, and a band stand erected with a
circular dancing platform round it, and a lot of alcoves and
nooks for refreshments under the band stand and round the
platform and in various parts of the gardens.&nbsp; A pavilion
for concerts was afterwards added.&nbsp; Before these
arrangements were made the dancing was in the long room of
Cremorne House, which was turned into the supper room.&nbsp; The
House was kept open during the summer in a languishing sort of
way till about 1848, when it <!-- page 42--><a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>came to grief
and was closed.&nbsp; About 1849 it was purchased by a Mr.
Simpson, I believe, a hotel keeper from near Covent Garden
Theatre, and the whole thing was greatly improved and decorated
and opened with some first-class music and popular
artistes.&nbsp; Two of the leading cornet players were engaged,
Coney and Arbin, and a great amount of vigour and energy were
thrown into its management, and from that time it became the most
popular place of amusement and appeared to be vieing with
Vauxhall Gardens, which were then on the wane of their
popularity.&nbsp; The land on the river front was taken in and
converted into a pleasure garden, and a rustic bridge thrown
across the road, connecting it with Cremorne proper, and river
fetes were given, with fireworks and the assistance of
steamboats.&nbsp; An hotel was built on the river front, and a
grand panorama of the Siege of Sebastopol, was shown with the
assistance of some of the Foot Guards.&nbsp; An accident happened
by the falling of a platform and several were injured.&nbsp; The
balloon ascents were a great feature by Lieutenant Gale, Adam,
and Coxwell taking up acrobats who performed on the trapeze in
mid air.&nbsp; A Madam Potoven ascended sitting on the back of a
white heifer fixed on a platform suspended from the car, and a
Frenchman came down in a parachute, falling opposite <!-- page
43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>Chelsea Church in Robert (now Sydney) Street, and was
killed.</p>
<p>The gardens went on successfully for many years under the able
management of Bishop, Partridge, and Adams, until the alteration
in the licensing laws, when the time of closing was fixed at
twelve, the beginning of the most profitable time.&nbsp; The
concern then fell into the hands of E. T. Smith, and was carried
on by him for a few years without any very marked
results&mdash;it appeared to have passed its pristine
glory.&nbsp; It then passed into the hands of the proprietor of
the Glove and Scents Emporium in the Gardens, who was the last
proprietor, for it was soon after closed for good, and the land,
together with the Ashburton estate and the Lots or Lammas Lands
were laid out and let for building purposes.&nbsp; The only part
left uncovered by buildings is the Ashburton Nursery on the
King&rsquo;s Road front.&nbsp; Vauxhall Gardens had been closed
some years so Cremorne was the only public gardens near London of
any account.</p>
<p>A great impetus to all places of amusement was caused by the
&rsquo;51 Exhibition in the Park.&nbsp; It was a grand year for
all people in business in London for the visitors were immense
from all quarters of the world, and you would meet in the streets
the costumes of all the nationalities of the globe.&nbsp; There
<!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>was an average of one hundred thousand visitors passing
the turnstiles every day, and on the last Thursday there were one
hundred and thirty seven thousand.</p>
<h2><!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>CHAPTER 7.&mdash;My First Census.</h2>
<p>The first census that I can recollect, if all the enumerators
had the experience I had, must have been a very incomplete and
misleading return.&nbsp; I was asked to take a section of four
hundred forms to deliver, get filled up and return, for which I
was to receive one guinea, and for every fifty beyond that number
two shillings and sixpence, and as I was told it would only take
a few hours on the Saturday afternoon to deliver, and the same on
the Monday to collect, I thought it was pretty good pay.&nbsp;
But never any more! for it took me nearly three weeks to
complete, and at least two-thirds of the papers I had to worry
out the particulars and fill them up myself as best I could, for
the people were very suspicious and had a notion that the
government had a sinister motive in getting these returns.&nbsp;
One was supposed to be that there was a conscription for the
army, and every able-bodied man was to serve, and another was
that they were going to introduce passports as they did on the
continent, and anything continental at that time was not at all
popular.</p>
<p><!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>I recollect the passing of the Reform Bill in &rsquo;32,
when there was a great illumination, and gangs of men and boys
went about breaking the windows of all the houses that were not
lit up.&nbsp; Nearly all the windows on one side of Smith Street
were broken.&nbsp; The illumination consisted of tallow candles
stuck in square lumps of clay, about six in each window.&nbsp;
Chelsea has always had a strong radical element, for during the
agitation over the Reform Bill, the Unionists had one or two
meeting houses.&nbsp; There was one in Leader Street, and another
in Doyley Street, and in &rsquo;48, the time of the Chartists,
one of the sections met on the Chelsea Common and marched with
their portion of the partisans to the great meeting on Kennington
Common, and returned in procession along the Kennington Road to
the Westminster Bridge.&nbsp; Here they were broken up by the
police and not allowed to proceed in procession, and the petition
was sent on in two four-wheeled cabs.&nbsp; There was great
excitement, and it was generally expected that there would be
serious rioting.&nbsp; Great precautions were taken, the military
were all confined to barracks, and a large number of artillery
with their guns from Woolwich were drafted into London overnight,
and all the body of local reserve men&mdash;old soldiers with
pensions&mdash;were kept under arms, and 100,000 special
constables were sworn in.</p>

Mondays and during the regatta was very active.&nbsp; There would
be two or three smart fellows from the cavalry with one or two
young fellows, posing as recruits, for decoys.&nbsp; The
artillery sergeant would be in smart blue uniform, and then came
the regiments of the line.&nbsp; The decoys for the latter were
two or three smartly dressed girls of doubtful character.&nbsp;
Then came the East India Company sergeant, and last but not least
came the recruiting for the Spanish legion.&nbsp; They all had
their gangs of harpies and hangers on, as the sergeant spent
money freely, every recruit being worth five to six pounds to
him.&nbsp; It was a common practice to get a lad half drunk over
night, and in the morning to bounce him that he had enlisted, and
there were always plenty to swear that he had done so.&nbsp; The
recruits for the Spanish legion were a rare motley crew, and
would go singing through the streets, half drunk, in gangs, that
they were going fighting for the Queen of Spain, and collect
drink and money.&nbsp; A good part of the crowd would be loafers
and not recruits at all.&nbsp; The great recruiting ground was
along the riverside, and at the public houses along the roads
leading to the fair at Wandsworth, which was held on a piece of
land in the York Road, just beyond where Wandsworth <!-- page
48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>Station now stands.&nbsp; The recruits for the Spanish
legion were a poor miserable lot, as they were the refuse from
the others.&nbsp; They would take them at any age, from sixteen
to fifty, and were not at all particular about size or health; in
fact, there is little doubt that lads of fourteen were sent
out.&nbsp; They used to assemble by Northumberland Passage,
Charing Cross, and march in gangs to Tower Hill to pass the Board
of Commissioners that sat in a room over a sailmaker&rsquo;s, and
having passed, would go by steamboat to Gravesend ready to
embark; and it was generally asserted that they never shipped
above two-thirds of the recruits they enlisted.&nbsp; The balance
would desert and enlist again, and were assisted in so doing by
the recruiting sergeant.</p>

49</span>CHAPTER 8.&mdash;The London Docks.</h2>
<p>People had to walk more in those days, as there was no riding
to your employment.&nbsp; I know the first employment I obtained
was at the London Docks as checker to the landing of goods, and I
had to get there by eight and leave at four.&nbsp; No time for
meals, which I had to eat behind the desk flap.&nbsp; I had to
stand all day on a wheeled platform, with a desk in front, that
was moved along the quay wherever it was wanted.&nbsp; It used to
take one and a half hours to get there; it was a long drag, but
as I got twelve shillings per week I thought it an important
post.&nbsp; I could sometimes if the tide served, get a ride home
by taking a scull and dropping up with the tide; they were
generally glad of a hand.&nbsp; I should think the dock labourer
was very much worse off in those days than at present, as there
appeared plenty of labourers, and they were only taken on as
wanted and discharged as soon as done with, many of the jobs
lasting only three hours, and the pay being fourpence per
hour.&nbsp; They got their shilling and were done with till they
got the next job.</p>
<p>I recollect the way one tail brawny Scotchman, <!-- page
50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>over
six feet high, named Macdonald, used to select his gangs; he
would go to the dock gates where the crowd was waiting, and not
say a word but plunge in and take those he wanted by the collar
and swing them round behind him just like you would select from a
drove of ponies, and his attendant would give them a ticket with
a number on it.&nbsp; From thence the engaged commenced the walk
from Chelsea to the docks, through the College Walk, up Ebury
Street, and through Elliot&rsquo;s, the Stag Brewery, always
having a look in at the stables at several of the most beautiful
black dray horses, splendidly kept and as well cared for as in a
nobleman&rsquo;s stables.&nbsp; Then up Castle Lane to
Palmer&rsquo;s Village, where I would meet a companion who was
employed in Thames Street, and then along York Street and Tuttle
Street, next out in the open space by Westminster Hospital, close
to Palace Yard, up the steps to the high pavement, and through a
passage by a public house to Westminster Bridge, through
Pedler&rsquo;s acre, along Stangate and Bankside, through the
Brewery, and come over the new Bridge just opened, and out by the
water wheel, along Thames Street, over Tower Hill to the
docks.&nbsp; I got my appointment through the interest of an old
Quaker gentleman who lived at No. 5 Paradise Row, with his two
sisters.&nbsp; I had to go of an evening <!-- page 51--><a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>to get
instructions in my duties, and he was very particular to impress
upon me that neatness was the most important point in
bookkeeping, and that the red ink lines in their proper place was
the beauty of a ledger, and never to erase a mistake, but draw
the red lines across it and enter the correction in red ink on
the margin, which I hear is still held good to the present
day.&nbsp; I have often walked from Chelsea to the Robin Hood at
Kingston Bottom and back after I had done my day&rsquo;s work, to
do my courting and see the young lady, the daughter of the head
gardener at Park House, who lived at the lodge by the entrance
gates.&nbsp; I was not a recognized suitor, and had to do the
courting under difficulties; I would go along the road past the
lawn and shrubbery to where the peacock roosted in the big trees,
and imitate its screech as a signal that I was there, and then
come along the road to where the fence and the hedge met and
squeeze through into the kitchen garden, and sit down on the
trunk of an old walnut tree and wait.&nbsp; It was here that most
of our courting was done.</p>
<p>This went on for some time, till the young lady was sent away
as companion to an old lady at Bath, but correspondence was both
difficult and expensive.&nbsp; As every letter cost eightpence
for postage it was too expensive to last long.&nbsp; I <!-- page
52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>would
sometime be able to get them franked, which was a privilege
allowed Members of Parliament and certain persons in an official
position to send them free of charge.&nbsp; I could generally get
a couple sent off in this way by meeting the manservant of an old
officer in the hospital, and treating him to a four of hot rum at
the Ph&oelig;nix Tavern, in Smith Street.</p>

53</span>CHAPTER 9.&mdash;An Exciting Experience.</h2>
<p>I was always fairly successful in getting employment, as I was
always ready and willing to earn a few shillings, our
circumstances being needy.&nbsp; I recollect sitting at home one
Saturday evening when a friend of mother&rsquo;s came in who kept
an old tavern at the bottom of Church Street, and was in sad
trouble.&nbsp; She had just been to Doctor Philpot at the corner
of the street for advice, and found out the doctor had been
attending her husband for what was then known as the &ldquo;Blue
Devils,&rdquo; after a drinking bout.&nbsp; The potman who had
attended to him had gone to take his pension and had not come
back, and could not be found anywhere, and the patient was very
restless, and there was no one in the house but her, the servant,
and a young girl who served in the bar.&nbsp; She was afraid to
be left, and I was asked if I would mind going home with her, and
if she could get no one else I was to stop there where the young
people and I knew each other well.&nbsp; I consented and started
with her.&nbsp; By that time it was nearly eleven o&rsquo;clock,
and we found the patient quiet, and <!-- page 54--><a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>had been
sleeping; and as soon as we could get the customers out, we
closed the house, and had a good supper.&nbsp; The servant had
been sitting with him.&nbsp; It was then past one o&rsquo;clock
when I went upstairs; it was a beautiful bright moonlight night,
with the moon shining in through the garret casements, making it
almost as light as day.&nbsp; There was very little furniture in
the room; an old three-legged round bedroom table and two or
three rush bottom chairs, a bedroom candlestick, and a tallow
dip.&nbsp; I had brought with me one of the sensational tales
that I had been reading at home, and sat quietly down to finish
the tale.&nbsp; It must have been some hours, as it was just
getting daylight, and the patient had not appeared to have moved,
but lay on his back with his eyes wide open and shining like
stars, staring at the ceiling.&nbsp; All of a sudden he appeared
to jump clean on the top of me, and clutch me by the throat,
upsetting the table and candle, and we both fell on the top of it
and crushed it like a match box, and then the struggle
commenced.&nbsp; We fought up and down, and in the struggle I
stripped every rag off him, and he appeared to be trying to get
me to the window to throw me out; and how our heels did rattle in
that midnight struggle on the old garret floor, as we danced
round in the shadow of the old Church on that Sunday morning.</p>
<p><!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>He was a little man, and I began to get the better of
him, and got him on his back on the floor and held his arms down,
when he made a plunge and snapped at my nose with his
teeth.&nbsp; He just grazed the skin, and looked up and
laughed.&nbsp; Of all the slippery things to handle, a naked man
beats everything.&nbsp; The noise we made brought his wife and
the two women in, and with their assistance we got him on to the
bedstead, and with strips of the sheet we tore up, we tied him
down to the bedstead, and he appeared to be pretty well done
up.&nbsp; By that hour it was time to open, as there were always
early customers on a Sunday morning, as it was a noted house for
Dog&rsquo;s Nose and other early drinks at that time.&nbsp; It
was then about seven, and we saw old Kirk, the beadle, going past
to dust and prepare the Church, and as he was a friend we called
him in for advice, and he suggested a straight waistcoat.&nbsp;
As he knew the master of the workhouse in Arthur Street, he
promised to go and borrow one, which he did, and brought one of
the old pauper nurses to show how to put it on.&nbsp; It was a
large shirt made of strong bed tick sewn up at the bottoms, with
two holes to put the legs through, and open behind, with strap
and buckles and sleeves a yard long, with large pieces of webbing
sewn at the ends.&nbsp; When we had got the patient comfortably
settled, I had some <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>breakfast and went home with five
shillings in my pocket, but I do not think I felt like taking on
another such job.</p>
<p>Funerals on the river in those days were a frequent
occurence.&nbsp; I recollect one in particular.&nbsp; A young man
invalided home from the East India Company Service in an advanced
stage of consumption came to stay with a sister at Chelsea.&nbsp;
The husband worked at the malt house on the river, and there the
young man died.&nbsp; He was a native of Mortlake and they took
him there by the river in a boat to bury him.&nbsp; I recollect
their going by our garden, we boys standing with our caps off
while the procession passed.&nbsp; There was one boat rowed by a
pair of sculls, containing the coffin and the mother and sisters
as chief mourners, followed by three or four boats full of
friends, most of the women in white dresses, and the men with
white scarves and bows, which was the usual mourning for an
unmarried person.</p>

57</span>CHAPTER 10.&mdash;A Boy&rsquo;s Tramp by Road to Epsom,
on Derby Day, 1837.</h2>
<p>At that time it was a difficulty to get to Epsom any other way
than tramping it, as there was no railway, and the lowest fare
was ten shillings, coach or van, and, being anxious for the
treat, I had saved up sixteen shillings and threepence, and by a
little diplomacy I had arranged to be abroad for the day without
letting anyone know where I was going.&nbsp; At about four
o&rsquo;clock on the Wednesday morning I started from Cheyne for
my trip, with my savings and two or three slices of bread and
butter in my pocket, and as I passed old Chelsea Church it was a
quarter to five, and a beautiful bright spring morning.&nbsp;
Going over Battersea Bridge and turning to the right through the
Folley, a colony of small cottages with a private way through
them into Church Street with fields and herb gardens on one side,
then <!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>passing Battersea Church and the draw-dock, into
Battersea Square, into the High Street and outside the Castle
Tavern.&nbsp; This being open was the first evidence of the road
to Epsom, as there was a donkey cart with five or six gipsy men
and women and one or two children with them.&nbsp; They had a
stack of peas and shooters, back scratchers, paper flowers,
plumes of feathers, and small bags of flour, also wooden dolls to
sell to the visitors on the road, as at that time the favourite
amusement was blowing peas through a tin tube at the people as
they drove along, and some of the peas would give one a very
painful experience.&nbsp; Throwing bags of flour was another
amusement indulged in.</p>
<p>Passing along High Street into Falcon Lane&mdash;then really a
lane with fields and market gardens on each side, and a small
stream where Clapham Junction now stands, then known as the
boling brook, and past some cottages to Battersea Rise, and then
up the hill past the old smithy that dated from 1626, on to the
Common and across it to the end of Nightingale Lane, and along a
footpath across where the Station and the St. James&rsquo;s
School now stand.&nbsp; It was then all common, and down
Wandsworth Lane to the Wheatsheaf on the main road.</p>
<p>Everything here was in evidence of the Derby proper.&nbsp; All
the gentlemen&rsquo;s houses had stands <!-- page 59--><a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>erected
inside the front gardens, and the walls decorated with festoons
of scarlet, most of them making it quite a gala day having dinner
parties to see the visitors in their grand equipages, for the
turn-outs of the aristocracy and royalty surpassed everything to
be seen anywhere in Europe.&nbsp; All the shops and private
houses had their windows decorated and full of visitors.&nbsp; It
was reported that thirty thousand horses at that time went to
Epsom on the Derby Day along the road at this point.&nbsp; The
wayfarers to the Derby were mostly horsey-looking tramps with
pails on their shoulders in twos and threes, very shabby and
down-at-heel.&nbsp; Both men and women, with almost every toy or
trinket you could mention; tin trumpets, squeakers, masks to sell
on the road, came slouching along; then came barrows, trucks,
donkey and pony carts, with all sorts of eatables, such as
sheep&rsquo;s trotters, whelks, oysters, bread and cheese, fried
sausages, saveloys, fish, ham and beef sandwiches, ginger beer
and table beer&mdash;at that time it was allowed to be sold
without a license.&nbsp; They would stroll along the road till
they found a suitable pitch, and would there establish
themselves.&nbsp; There were numerous parties of musicians in
gangs of three or four, harp, violin and cornet, or cornet,
trombone and French horn; armies of acrobats and children on
stilts, conjuring, Punch <!-- page 60--><a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>and Judy
shows; in fact, some on every open space all down the road to the
Downs.</p>
<p>The road through the village of Tooting to the Broadway, where
you turned off in the Mitcham Road, was the most crowded, for
some of the traffic divided and went straight on through Merton
and Ewell to Epsom, but the greater part went by the Mitcham
Road, past Daniel Defoe&rsquo;s house and Fig&rsquo;s Marsh, a
long strip of marsh common on one side and the herb and lavender
gardens on the other, and a number of wooden cottages with long
gardens in front, that made quite a harvest by selling nosegays
and refreshments.&nbsp; This extended all the way to the village
of Mitcham, the Upper Green at which the Pleasure Fair is held to
the present day, I believe the only one remaining near the
metropolis, and at a stall outside the Ram I made my first halt
for breakfast.&nbsp; I indulged in coffee, plum cake, fried
sausages, and bread and butter, at the cost of eight-pence, and
started on my way at seven by the clock at the Lavender
Distillery, passed through the toll-gate down the road to Mitcham
Green, a large open piece of green sward considered at that time
one of the best cricket fields in Surrey, and producing some of
the best cricketers, and still maintaining that character.&nbsp;
I proceeded down the road with several good residences on each
side and almost an avenue of <!-- page 61--><a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>trees and may
hedges in full bloom, the road alive with every kind of vehicle
and a large number of tramps.&nbsp; At the corner of Mitcham
Green had collected a large number of itinerant musicians, and
all sorts of diverting vagabonds, looking very shabby, dusty and
down at heel, and as if it was anything but a prosperous
occupation.&nbsp; There were no negro melodies in those days, but
there was the troubadour with his guitar, wearing a broad-brimmed
hat with a large feather and loose coloured slashed coat and
short cape or cloak loose on his shoulders, and singing love
songs, and a man with trestles and a sort of tray strung with
wires, played with two short pieces of cane or whale bone with a
knob of leather on the end, with which he struck the wires and
knocked out a tune, and, by the same process, with bells arranged
on a straight bar fixed on high trestles, tunes were played.</p>
<p>The long, straggling village of Mitcham was the end of the
crowded inhabited part of the road to Epsom; past the old Brewery
and one or two old houses you came to the old mill and bridge
crossing the river Wandle, with a ford by the side where nearly
every vehicle drove through water, and as soon as you crossed,
the avenue of fine old elms commenced, and meeting overhead
formed quite a delightful shade.&nbsp; Meadows and park-like
grounds on <!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>each side, were well wooded, with
only two residences and one farmhouse, an old house apparently
half farmhouse and half residence, with very pretty gardens in
front with a number of shrubs cut and trained into all manner of
grotesque and fantastic shapes.&nbsp; The land on each side all
the way to Sutton was purely agricultural and grazing land.</p>
<p>The first buildings you came to on entering the village were
some old wooden cottages and the smithy, adjoining which was the
cage or lock-up, outside of which was the village constable and
his assistants, two or three labourers sworn in for the
occasion.&nbsp; The village consisted of one long, straggling
street of small low cottages and a few mean shops, hardly a good
house, saving the Inns, consisting of the &ldquo;Angel,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;Greyhound,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Cock.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The two latter were large coaching stations, the
&ldquo;Cock,&rdquo; with a big open space in front.&nbsp; The
villagers were making their harvest by having tables outside and
selling milk in small yellow mugs about the size of a jam pot at
a penny each, and small loaves with currants and home-made
cakes.&nbsp; Outside the &ldquo;Cock&rdquo; was a Punch and Judy
performing to an admiring crowd, and by the toll-gate at the
corner of the Cheam Road was the first breakdown.&nbsp; An old
landau with eight occupants, drawn by a big cart horse, had
parted <!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>right in half and shot all its
contents into the road, and a general squabble commenced,
especially among the ladies who, according to their account, had
prophecied the disaster at starting.&nbsp; But the matter was
soon settled as with willing hands the broken carriage was moved
into a field by the roadside and they made themselves comfortable
by falling to on the provisions, and I left them having a picnic
in the broken vehicle.</p>
<p>Then along the road till you come to a long open common or
waste land covered with rushes, grass and coarse scrubby growth
to another toll-gate, of which I think I counted seven.</p>
<h2><!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>CHAPTER 11.&mdash;On the Downs.</h2>
<p>At eleven I turned down a lane about a mile before you get to
the town, and over a stile and through corn-fields by a path that
brought you to the Downs.&nbsp; At the bottom of the hill there
was a large and busy crowd at that time in the morning although
but a few visitors had arrived.&nbsp; The Grand Stand was there
and the Enclosure, although very much smaller than at
present.&nbsp; Tents and booths covered the ground extending at
least one-third of the extent of the course, with the signs of
well-known London taverns, long booths, fitted as stables with
livery stable-keepers with familiar names attached.&nbsp; Boxing
booths, single-stick and quarter-staff and wrestling booths.</p>
<p>One large refreshment booth had up for a sign in large
letters&mdash;&ldquo;Dan Regan, the Cambridge Gyp.&nbsp;
Refreshments and good accommodation for man and beast.&nbsp;
Palliasse prostration with matin peck, two-and-sixpence,&rdquo;
and appeared to be doing a good trade.&nbsp; The accommodation a
shakedown on some planks, and breakfast in the morning.</p>
<p><!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>There did not appear to be any professional bookmakers,
but the betting was carried on quite happily in the tavern booths
and shops everywhere by everybody.&nbsp; Towards twelve
o&rsquo;clock the company began to arrive and get into place
alongside the course, the four-in-hands drawn up, and carriages
of every description, mostly taking out the horses to the stables
in the tents, and formed a row two deep.&nbsp; The vans and other
vehicles forming lower down in the same way, but further from the
Grand Stand, and taking out the horses and tying them to the
wheels, hundreds of loafers thus being busy selling pails of
water and forcing their services to rub down and generally to
extort a fee.</p>
<p>There was almost everything to be had on the course in the way
of eatables and drinkables; occupants of carriages and drags
began to have their lunches spread on the top of those vehicles;
corks began to pop and a general onslaught was made on the
provisions by everybody.&nbsp; The entertainments commenced their
business.&nbsp; Sharpers in plenty, roulette tables, dice,
three-card trick, pea and thimble, and the pricking in a curled
up strap, and every phase of gambling without let or
hindrance.</p>
<p>At about one a bell rang, the horses were brought out on to
the course for one of the minor races, the course cleared by the
few police there were, and <!-- page 66--><a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>the race run
with very little excitement, for there did not appear to be much
interest taken in the three or four races that were run before
and after the great event of the day, the Derby, that was run
about half past two or a quarter to three, when the company had
fed and had got pretty well primed with wine, and the noise
became furious and the excitement immense.</p>
<p>There was a great concourse of people, and standing on the
hill just before the Derby was run it looked one black moving
mass, and you could see almost the whole of the course from start
to finish.&nbsp; The races after the Derby did not appear to
attract the visitors so much as the early ones, and drinking and
the other amusements appeared to be all in full swing and had
plenty of patrons, and there was gambling of every form.&nbsp; I
tried my luck at it with varied good and bad luck, but about five
in the evening had spent about two shillings and a penny.&nbsp; I
found I had only sevenpence halfpenny to carry me home out of my
sixteen shillings and threepence which I had started with, so
someone was thirteen shillings to the good; but, anyhow, I had
seen the Derby, and had thoroughly enjoyed the trip so far.&nbsp;
There then set in a general activity and bustle of brushing up
and putting to of horses and preparing for the start home.&nbsp;
However the people got <!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>their right horses and so few
accidents happened was amazing.</p>
<p>The best of the turn-outs got away first, and the company
appeared to be getting livelier, and were decorating themselves
with false noses and masks and dolls stuck in their hats, and
blowing tin trumpets and using tin tubes to blow peas as they
passed by the best of the turn-outs, and there were a large
number of them, with the carriages drawn by four post horses and
ridden by the post boys in coloured satin jackets, white top
hats, breeches and top boots, different coloured striped jackets,
silk or velvet jockey caps.&nbsp; The best of them had relays of
horses which they changed at the &ldquo;Cock,&rdquo; at Sutton, a
favourite halting house.&nbsp; About six in the evening the road
became crowded with both vehicles and pedestrians of every
description, many of them driving most recklessly, and a
breakdown of some sort occurred at every half mile.&nbsp; I
counted four wagonettes, three light carts, one carriage and four
vans, complete wrecks, and left in the ditches and the fields by
the roadside, and several with shafts broken and otherwise
damaged and tied up with ropes.&nbsp; The roadsides appeared like
one continual fair all the way from the course, and the company
playing all manner of mad antics.</p>
<p>At Sutton a carriage containing four ladies and <!-- page
68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>a
foreign-looking old gentleman, all elegantly dressed, and a man
sitting on the box, had the misfortune for the post boys to get
so drunk that one of them fell off his horse and had to be left
behind, and the other was so incapable that he had run into
several traps and done damage and was stopped by a threatening
crowd, when he got off his horse and wanted to fight and was
quite unable to continue his journey.&nbsp; Just then a
four-in-hand drove up and was appealed to by the lady occupants
for assistance.&nbsp; Two of the gentlemen volunteered to ride in
the place of the post boys.&nbsp; The one left was with
assistance tied in the provision hampers and fastened behind the
carriage, while the two gentlemen mounted the horses and drove
off amid cheers of an admiring crowd, looking, in their dress
coats, top hats and green gauze veils and trousers not at all
like post boys; but they appeared to be quite at home on their
mounts, and the ladies and all started for home, quite
happy.&nbsp; In getting nearer to London the crowd got thicker
and the fun and horse-play became more furious, many of them
halting at the taverns by the roadside, at all of which there was
a large number stopping outside and in the fields provided for
that purpose.</p>
<p>Getting towards Mitcham the pea shooting and the flour
throwing commenced, and the men selling <!-- page 69--><a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>bags of flour
there for sixpence, were doing a roaring trade.&nbsp; The pelting
led to a good many disturbances, often ending in a fight.&nbsp;
The occupants of the various carriages and drags made themselves
conspicuous by dressing up in paper coloured hats and false
beards, and using fans and kissing their hands and bowing to the
girls and women along the road; and most of the traps were
decorated with large branches of may and horse chestnut blooms
that had been torn from the hedges and the trees by the
roadside.</p>
<p>It was now drawing towards seven, and I began to get a bit
tired, dusty and footsore, when I saw an opportunity of a ride,
and by a little man&oelig;uvring I got behind a carriage without
being seen by the occupants, and sat myself down comfortably on
the step and had a nice ride all through Mitcham and Fig&rsquo;s
Marsh, with only a flip with the whip now and then from a passing
driver.&nbsp; Getting into the Mitcham Road and the Broadway I
had to contest my possession of the seat with several boys who
wanted it, and at the corner of the Broadway just turning into
the Tooting Road, a biggish, rough-looking fellow who had been
trying to get possession of my seat, snatched off my cap and
threw it down in the road.&nbsp; I got off, collared and began to
punch him, and had one or two rounds just opposite <!-- page
70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>the
Castle tavern.&nbsp; A crowd quickly surrounded us, and we were
soon supplied with seconds, and were hustled by them through the
large stable yard of the Castle tavern into a meadow at the back,
attended by a large crowd of both men and women, and stripped for
a regular fight.&nbsp; I certainly was the younger and the
lighter of the two, but my knowledge of the use of my hands stood
me in good stead of both weight and age.&nbsp; We had a fair
stand-up fight, the only one I ever had in my life, and was well
attended.&nbsp; I got terribly punished in the body, but not a
crack on the face.&nbsp; It lasted nearly twenty minutes, when a
master butcher that was well known in the neighbourhood, pushed
through the crowd and said that &ldquo;The young &rsquo;un has
had enough of it,&rdquo; and the crowd began to murmur, when the
butcher turned round and said, &ldquo;If any of you particularly
want a fight, you can have one.&nbsp; I do not mind obliging
you,&rdquo; but the offer did not seem to be accepted.</p>

pay us a visit, generally consisting of from nine to twelve, all
men or lads.&nbsp; They had the appearance of countrymen, dressed
some in smock frocks, others in shirt-sleeves, breeches and
gaiters, and all decked out in coloured ribbons tied round their
hats, arms, and knees of their breeches, with long streamers, and
others carrying short sticks with ribbons twisted round, and bows
on top, or garlands of flowers tied on small hoops.&nbsp; They
generally stopped outside the taverns in the roadway and danced
to a drum and pan pipes, tambourine and triangle.&nbsp; They
would form themselves into three rows, according to their number,
about three feet apart each way, and would dance a sort of jig,
and change places by passing in and out and turning round to face
one another, striking their sticks and twisting their garlands to
the time of the music, and then stamp their feet and give a sort
of whoop or shout, and finish with a chant in honour of the month
of May, and make a collection among the crowd.</p>

72</span>The &ldquo;Endeavour,&rdquo; a wooden paddle boat, was
the first to run three times a week from Dyer&rsquo;s Hall Wharf,
London Bridge, to Hampton Court; leaving London Bridge at nine
and passing Chelsea at about a quarter past ten.&nbsp; The
passengers had to be put on board in the wherries at a charge of
threepence each.&nbsp; A signal was made from the Yorkshire Grey
stairs for them to lay to to take them on board, as there was no
pier at Chelsea at that time.&nbsp; The boat, always once or
twice during the summer, would come to grief under Battersea
Bridge by knocking its paddle-box off, and get a-ground once or
twice before it got to Hampton Court.&nbsp; I have several times
seen her a-ground just before you get to Kew Bridge, and lay
there for two or three hours with no way of getting ashore but by
being carried on men&rsquo;s backs through the mud.&nbsp; The
fare was three shillings and sixpence, and five shillings.&nbsp;
They always advertised &ldquo;Weather and Tide
permitting.&rdquo;&nbsp; If everything was favourable they would
arrive about half past twelve and leave again at four.&nbsp; The
passengers were not very numerous.&nbsp; The boat ran for about
two years, and then one called the &ldquo;Locomotive&rdquo;
started, a very much superior boat, and much quicker; and a start
was made for a ider of a very primitive character at the
Yorkshire <!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>Grey stairs&mdash;merely two old coal
barges with gangways from the shore, and one from a landing
stage.&nbsp; A company was then formed called the Chelsea
Steamboat Company, with four small wooden boats, and a pier was
built.</p>
<p>The Wellesley Street tragedy (now called Upper Manor Street),
occurred on the left hand side about four or five doors from the
top.&nbsp; The house was kept by an old lady who let the best
part to lodgers, and on one Sunday evening about nine she had
taken her supper beer from the potman at the Wellesley Arms, who
came round in those days at meal times with a tray made for the
purpose of carrying beer to be sold at the customers&rsquo;
doors; and about eleven o&rsquo;clock the people who occupied the
upper part of the house came home and opened the door, but did
not find any light as they expected, as it was usual for the old
lady to leave a candle burning on the ledge of the staircase
window.&nbsp; They went to a neighbour to get a light and
returned and found the old lady at the foot of the stairs.&nbsp;
She appeared to have been stunned and then strangled.&nbsp; The
jug with the beer was standing on the stairs, the place had not
been robbed, and nothing had been disturbed.&nbsp; The people in
the house had been recently married, and it had been their
practice to go away the whole of the Sunday <!-- page 74--><a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>and spend it
with their friends.&nbsp; There were several arrests, but there
appeared to be no clue, and the matter was never cleared up; the
only theory was that it was a contemplated robbery, someone
knocking her down and then strangling her, but got scared and
took to flight without taking any thing.</p>

75</span>CHAPTER 13&mdash;Politics on Kennington Common.</h2>
<p>There appears always to have been a radical element in
Chelsea, for a large contingent met on Chelsea Common and marched
to Kennington Common to give the Dorsetshire Labourers, Frost,
Williams, and Jones, a grand reception on their return from
imprisonment.&nbsp; They were drawn by four horses in a hackney
carriage with outriders, and followed by a large number of
vehicles occupied by their admirers, and a large crowd, when a
meeting was held on Kennington Common, and violent speeches were
made.&nbsp; The crowd became very disorderly, some ugly rushes
were made, and the few police and constables who were there got
very roughly handled, and in one of the scrimmages a
policeman&rsquo;s top hat was knocked off, and got kicked, and I
had a kick at it&mdash;what boy would not do so?&nbsp; In the
excitement, anyhow, I got collared, and was being dragged away
when a rush was made, the police upset, and we all rolled in the
mud together, and I got away.&nbsp; More police came up and began
to hunt the crowd, and made many arrests.&nbsp; I, in one of the
crowds, rushed down a <!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>mews at the back of the houses in the
Kennington Road.&nbsp; As I was without a cap, and covered in mud
and my face was bleeding, it was thought they were after me, so I
was picked bodily up and pitched over the wall into a lilac bush
in one of the long gardens, and I slid down on to a stone garden
roller on which I sat, pretty well dazed and thoroughly done
up.&nbsp; I do not think I was noticed by the people in the
house, for I sat there some considerable time, when some children
from an upper window noticed me.&nbsp; Soon after, an old
gentleman in a dressing gown and a scarlet smoking cap and two or
three ladies appeared on a sort of verandah at the back of the
house, and had a good look at me, but did not attempt to come
down in the garden.&nbsp; Presently two men came up the steps
from the kitchen under the verandah, one of them dressed as a
groom, and the other in his shirt sleeves and a big rough hairy
cap on, who I found afterwards was the potman at the White Bear
Tavern opposite, while the other was the doctor&rsquo;s groom,
who lived two or three doors higher up the road, who had been
fetched in to arrest me.&nbsp; They brought me up into the hall
at the bottom of the kitchen stairs, and the old gentleman began
to question how I got into such a scrape, and where I came
from.&nbsp; When I told him I came from Chelsea <!-- page 77--><a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>near the
Hospital, he asked if I knew any of the officers, and as I
mentioned several of them by name that he knew; he told me he was
a retired army surgeon.&nbsp; I was allowed to go into the
scullery to have a wash and brush the mud off, and it was
suggested by the potman that I had better stop until it was dark
for fear I should be known, and as I had no cap he went off to
his mistress and begged an old one belonging to one of her boys,
who had just gone back to school.&nbsp; As soon as it was dark I
was let up the area steps and started home and went to bed saying
nothing about it, but felt awfully sore and bad.</p>
<p>In speaking of the King&rsquo;s Road I forgot to mention a
very famous pump which stood opposite the &ldquo;Six
Bells,&rdquo; close to the old burial ground, and that had the
reputation of giving the most transparent and sparkling water
that was to be obtained, which was fetched from far and
near.&nbsp; The boys used to play some trick by placing a large
stone up the curved nozzle, so that when the servants came with
their jugs and began to pump it would send out the stone and
through the bottoms of the jugs.&nbsp; It got complained of, and
the parish put a grating which stopped that little game.&nbsp;
The reputation of the water went on till some wag asserted that a
human tooth had been pumped up and found its <!-- page 78--><a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>way to the
water bottle on the dressing table.&nbsp; It then began to dawn
on the authorities that it might not be so wholesome as reported,
and the handle of the old pump was chained up, and soon after the
road was widened by taking a part of the burial ground, and the
old pump was done away with.</p>
<h2><!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>CHAPTER 14.&mdash;Knightsbridge.</h2>
<p>At Knightsbridge there used to be a toll collector, but I do
not recollect any toll gate.&nbsp; A man used to come out of a
gate in the fence to collect it, about where the Bank now stands,
beside it the Cannon Brewery, a large building with a cannon at
the top, with the back overlooking the park.&nbsp; That and
White&rsquo;s menagerie, adjoining the Fox and Bull tavern, were
pulled down, and one of the first National Exhibitions was built
on the ground.&nbsp; It was for a collection formed by a doctor
who had travelled in China.&nbsp; It was a collection of all
sorts of curios, illustrative of the habits, idol worship and
life and industry of the Chinese, with native workmen and women
carrying on their various trades and domestic apparatus, as they
did at home with their temples, and performances in idol
worship.&nbsp; It was first exhibited at the back of the
Alexandra Hotel in a large room in the old barrack yard, and it
was such a success that in the following year the large brick
building was built on the site of the Cannon Brewery.&nbsp; There
were a lot of immense <!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>stuffed dragons and winged snakes and
flying fish and many-headed monsters and curious reptiles that
had never been seen in Europe before, and several Chinese ladies
sitting on pedestals exhibiting their deformed feet, which looked
like hoofs with a row of small lumps of flesh underneath with
nails that represented the toes.&nbsp; There was a large number
of visitors, and it kept open for about two years, having had
some waxworks added to its attractions.</p>
<p>A little beyond the Alexandra Hotel stood a dairy that was
noted for its asses&rsquo; milk, which at that time was
considered a cure for consumption.&nbsp; There would be as many
as forty donkeys there of a morning and they would be driven in
pairs by boys round to the customers and milked at their doors
twice a day, which was a very large and profitable business.</p>
<p>On the Knightsbridge Road, opposite Gore House, stood an old
tavern in the middle of the road with some old stables and sheds,
a great place for the market carts and country wagons to stop at
of a morning.&nbsp; Gore House became the residence of the
Countess of Blessington, her daughter and Count D&rsquo;Orsay, a
very handsome and fashionable Frenchman.&nbsp; There were large
grounds attached to the house and they used to give very grand
garden parties both public and private, many of them for <!--
page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>charities.&nbsp; I recollect going to one given for the
benefit of the Caledonian School.&nbsp; It was a very grand and
fashionable Fancy Fair with the guards and the Caledonian School
band, and Athletic Sports, trials of strength, sword dances and
the Highland fling, putting the stone and flinging the hammer,
the bag-pipes, and many other Scotch pastimes.&nbsp; The grounds
were very beautiful.&nbsp; The property was bought by the
commissioners of the &rsquo;51 Exhibition from their surplus
funds, and the Albert Hall now stands on the site.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Admiral Kepple&rdquo; tavern at the top of College
Street stood by itself, with tea garden at the back, and at the
west side in the Fulham Road was the old parish pond, and a
little farther west at the back of about where the
&ldquo;Stag&rdquo; tavern now stands was a large pond from which
Pond Place took its name.&nbsp; The present road in front of
Chelsea Hospital was only a footpath that was closed every Holy
Thursday; and the parish authorities beat the bounds, which they
did on Holy Thursdays with the two beadles in uniform, the
churchwardens, overseers, and parish constable, and the
way-warden; and a great number of school children with willow
wands would perambulate the parish to beat the bounds, and would
knock down the obstruction and pass through the district called
Jews&rsquo; Row at that <!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>part, a labyrinth of courts and
passages of small and two-roomed houses.&nbsp; It was called
Jews&rsquo; Row, bounded by White Lion Street on the east,
Turk&rsquo;s Row on the north, and Franklin&rsquo;s Row on the
west, and was inhabited by the very lowest and most depraved and
criminal class both male and female, many low lodging houses and
thieves&rsquo; kitchens, and the roadway was at least one foot
six inches lower than the path, and all along the curb the low,
loose women would sit and insult and rob the passers by.&nbsp; It
was quite impossible to arrest them as they escaped down the
labyrinth of courts and alleys, and it was so well-known as a
dangerous locality that very few people would venture through it,
while the district lying to the east between White Lion Street
and the boundary of the parish, and Chelsea Market, where Sloane
Gardens now stand, was nearly as bad, with courts and alleys and
crime and depravity.&nbsp; As a market it had long been
disused.&nbsp; I can just recollect a few poor miserable stalls
on the large open space enclosed by posts and rails in front of
the shops in Lower Sloane Street, where Sloane Gardens now
stand.&nbsp; This district is now nearly all swept away and made
one of the best and most fashionable residential districts of the
west of London.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
